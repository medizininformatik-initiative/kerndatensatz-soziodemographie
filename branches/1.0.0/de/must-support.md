## Must Support

For querying and reading MII Profiles, **Must Support** on any profile data element **SHALL** be interpreted as follows:

### Mandatory Elements

Elements of a FHIR resource can be defined in a profile as mandatory or "Must Support". Mandatory elements are elements with a minimum cardinality of 1 (min=1). When an element is mandatory, the data is expected to always be present. In rare cases, data may be missing despite a minimum cardinality of 1. Guidance for cases where data is missing can be found in the [Missing Data](missing-data.md) section.

### Must Support Elements

Resource elements marked as "Must Support" (MS) in a profile must be supported by systems that claim conformance to that particular profile. This is different from cardinality. It is possible to have an element with a minimum cardinality of 0, but still expect systems to support the element.

Support (Must Support) of an element is understood within the MII core dataset specifications as follows:

A distinction is made between data-requesting systems (recipients/clients) and data-providing systems (senders/servers). In the context of the MII infrastructure, the FHIR API of a Data Integration Center (DIZ) is the sending system that accepts requests.

#### Server Expectations

§must-support-1:For **Must Support** elements, the Server **SHALL** be capable of meaningfully populating the element if the data is locally available, storing it in a resource, and making it retrievable upon request.§

The system (sender/server) **SHALL** be capable of:

* Meaningfully populating a Must Support element with data (e.g., via ETL processes from primary data sources), if the data is locally available
* Storing the element in a resource
* Making it retrievable upon request (e.g., feasibility query)

#### Client Expectations

§must-support-2:For **Must Support** elements, the Client **SHALL** be capable of displaying the element to the user, considering it for calculations, and processing resource instances containing it without error.§

The data-requesting system (recipient/client) **SHALL** be capable of:

* Displaying the element to the user
* Considering it for further calculations or other processing
* Processing resource instances containing the Must Support data elements without generating an error or causing the application to fail

#### Missing Data

* §must-support-3:When information on a particular data element is not present, and the reason for absence is unknown, MII Servers **SHALL NOT** include the data element in the resource instance returned as part of the query results§
* §must-support-4:When querying MII Servers, MII Clients **SHALL** interpret missing data elements within resource instances as data not present in the MII Server's system§
* §must-support-5:When information on a particular data element is missing, and the MII Server knows the precise reason for the absence of data, MII Servers **SHOULD** send the reason for the missing information following the guidance in the [Missing Data](missing-data.md) section§

### Presentation of Must Support and Mandatory Elements

On each profile page, several different formal views of the profile contents are displayed in a tree format under tabs labeled "Differential Table", "Key Elements Table", and "Snapshot Table".

#### Differential Table View

Elements with a cardinality starting with "1" under the column header "Card." (e.g., 1..1) are **Mandatory** elements. Elements labeled **Must Support** in the "Differential Table" view are flagged with an S.

#### Must Support - Primitive Elements

Primitive elements are single elements with a primitive value. §must-support-6:For **Must Support** primitive elements, the Server **SHALL** be capable of providing the element value.§ §must-support-7:For **Must Support** primitive elements, the Client **SHALL** be capable of processing the element value.§

For example, if an element like `Patient.birthDate` is marked as Must Support:

* MII Servers **SHALL** be capable of providing a value in `Patient.birthDate`
* MII Clients **SHALL** be capable of processing the value in `Patient.birthDate`

#### Must Support - Complex Elements

Complex elements are composed of primitive and other complex elements. §must-support-8:For any complex element marked as **Must Support**, the Server **SHALL** be capable of providing the sub-element values that are marked as **Must Support**. If no sub-elements are marked as **Must Support**, the Server **SHALL** be capable of providing at least one sub-element value.§ §must-support-9:For **Must Support** complex elements, the Client **SHALL** be capable of processing the **Must Support** sub-element values.§ When sub-elements of a complex element are marked as **Must Support**, the support expectation for the parent element is fulfilled by supporting those marked sub-elements.

For example, if `Patient.name` is labeled **Must Support** and has **Must Support** sub-elements "family" and "given":

* MII Servers **SHALL** be capable of providing values in `Patient.name.family` and `Patient.name.given`
* MII Clients **SHALL** be capable of processing the values in `Patient.name.family` and `Patient.name.given`

On the other hand, if any sub-element is marked as **Must Support** and the parent element is not, there is **no expectation** that you must support the parent. However, §must-support-10:for **Must Support** complex elements, if the parent element is represented in the structure but is not itself marked as **Must Support**, Servers **SHALL** support the **Must Support** sub-element(s).§

#### Must Support - Resource References

§must-support-11:When a **Must Support** reference element has a single target profile, the target profile **SHALL** be supported.§

For example, if `Condition.subject` references the MII Patient profile and is marked as Must Support:

* MII Servers **SHALL** be capable of providing a `Condition.subject` with a valid reference to an MII Patient Profile
* MII Clients **SHALL** be capable of processing a `Condition.subject` with a valid reference to an MII Patient Profile

§must-support-12:When a **Must Support** reference element has multiple target profiles and none are labeled as **Must Support**, **at least one** target profile **SHALL** be supported.§

#### Must Support - Choice of Data Types

§must-support-13:For **Must Support** choice elements, the Server **SHALL** support the datatypes labeled as **Must Support**.§ §must-support-14:For **Must Support** choice elements, the Client **SHALL** be capable of processing all datatypes labeled as **Must Support**.§

For example, if `Observation.value[x]` has multiple Must Support datatypes:

* MII Servers **SHALL** be capable of populating the labeled Must Support datatypes (e.g., `valueQuantity`, `valueCodeableConcept`, `valueString`)
* MII Clients **SHALL** be capable of processing all labeled Must Support datatypes
* Systems **MAY** support other choice elements, but this is not a requirement

#### Must Support - Slices

FHIR profiles use [slicing](http://hl7.org/fhir/R4/profiling.html#slicing) to define constraints on repeating elements. The element that defines the slicing discriminator ("slicer") may be marked as **Must Support**, but each slice must be explicitly tagged with the **Must Support** property to define that slice's conformance requirements. §must-support-15:For **Must Support** slice elements, the Server **SHALL** be capable of providing data that conforms to the explicitly **Must Support**-tagged slices.§ §must-support-16:For **Must Support** slice elements, the Client **SHALL** be capable of processing data that conforms to the explicitly **Must Support**-tagged slices.§

For example, if `Identifier` is a Must Support slicer element and defines slices for different identifier types, only the slices explicitly marked as Must Support are required:

* MII Servers **SHALL** be capable of providing identifiers that conform to the Must Support slices
* MII Clients **SHALL** be capable of processing identifiers that conform to the Must Support slices
* Systems **MAY** support other slices, but this is not required
