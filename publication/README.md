# Publishing a release

Formal releases use the manual
[`go-publish.yml`](../.github/workflows/go-publish.yml) workflow. A run with
`publish: false` performs a complete dry run. A run with `publish: true`
rebuilds the candidate, commits it to `gh-pages`, and deploys it through GitHub
Pages.

Each run resolves the latest published IG Publisher, SUSHI, and Jekyll, plus
the current default branches of the HL7 publication templates and FHIR IG
Registry and the MII terminology-proxy configuration. The exact versions and
commit revisions used by the run are recorded in the job summary and
`publication-review` artifact; no workflow pins need to be refreshed for a
release.

This setup follows the
[IG Publisher publication guide](https://www.argentixinfo.com/ig/howtopub/publication.html).

## Fixed URLs

- Publication website:
  `https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/kerndatensatz-soziodemographie`
- FHIR canonical:
  `https://www.medizininformatik-initiative.de/fhir/ext/modul-soziodemographie`
- Development build:
  `https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/kerndatensatz-soziodemographie/branches/main/`

The website and canonical intentionally differ. Keep the MII canonical in the
IG and package metadata. `publication/webroot/publish-setup.json` uses the Pages
URL with `"server": "cloud"` and `"canonical-mismatch": true`.
After publication, the workflow sets the history renderer's supported `altloc`
field so the Current Versions date links to the permanent Pages release rather
than to the canonical.

The formal workflow owns the root and version directories on `gh-pages`.
Continuous builds own only `branches/<branch-name>/`. Do not copy the complete
`publication/webroot` directory to `gh-pages`; it is workflow input.

The `gh-pages` branch remains the durable, version-controlled publication tree,
but it is not the Pages publishing source. After updating that branch, the
workflows upload its complete contents as a Pages artifact and deploy the
artifact with GitHub Actions. Keep the branch and its existing releases when
changing the Pages source.

## One-time setup

Skip items that are already complete.

1. In **Settings → Pages → Build and deployment → Source**, select **GitHub
   Actions**, not **Deploy from a branch**.
2. After selecting the Pages source, open **Settings → Environments →
   github-pages** and set **Deployment branches and tags** to **No
   restriction**. GitHub can create or reset this environment when the Pages
   source changes, so configure it after step 1. The setting is required because
   preview deployments run from non-`main` branches while formal deployments
   run from `main`. Leave this environment without required reviewers or wait
   timers so previews deploy automatically; production authorization belongs to
   the separate `publication` environment.
3. In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Variables**, set the
   repository variable `PAGES_ACTIONS_ENABLED=true`. Enable it only after steps
   1 and 2 are complete.
4. Create or protect the `publication` environment and configure the required
   reviewers and self-review policy for production publication. If its
   deployment branches and tags are restricted, allow `main`, and run the
   manual publication workflows from the `main` version. Do not put the
   terminology secrets in either environment; builds read them before the
   separate deployment job starts.
5. In **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → Secrets**, configure the
   repository secrets `CDS_DEV_CLIENT_CERT`,
   `CDS_DEV_CLIENT_KEY`, and `CDS_DEV_CLIENT_CERT_PASSWORD`.
   Store the certificate and encrypted private key as base64 and the password
   used to decrypt that key as plain secret text. These must be repository or
   organization secrets because the consuming build jobs do not reference an
   environment.
6. Keep the `gh-pages` branch and its `.nojekyll` file. Any branch protection
   rule or ruleset on `gh-pages` must permit GitHub Actions to push directly.
   Push `main` and wait for **Build and Publish IG** to populate
   `gh-pages/branches/main/`, deploy the complete branch tree, and publish the
   development URL.

The workflows use GitHub's built-in, job-scoped `GITHUB_TOKEN`; do not create a
repository secret named `GITHUB_TOKEN` or a personal access token. Repository
and organization policy must allow the explicit `contents: write`,
`pages: write`, `id-token: write`, and `pull-requests: write` permissions used
by the relevant jobs. The **Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull
requests** setting is not required for commenting on an existing PR. Failure to
update the convenience PR comment is warning-only because the job summary
remains the authoritative deployment report.

Pull requests from forks do not receive the terminology repository secrets, so
their Publisher build cannot use the authenticated terminology proxy without a
separate, explicitly reviewed fork workflow.

### First formal publication: 2027.0.0-ballot

`2027.0.0-ballot` is the first formal publication of this module. There is no
previously published release and no imported history: `publication-request.json`
declares `"first": true`, and when the Pages root does not yet contain
`package-list.json`, the workflow bootstraps the publication webroot from the
seed files in `publication/webroot/` (feeds, package list, package registry,
publish setup) and installs the history template. IG Publisher `-go-publish`
then creates the initial publication history itself. Later releases must switch
`publication-request.json` to `"first": false`.

Before running `2027.0.0-ballot` with `publish: true`:

1. Ensure `publication/webroot/package-feed.xml` is committed as
   `/package-feed.xml` on `gh-pages`.
2. Submit and merge the one-time
   [`package-feeds.json`](https://github.com/FHIR/ig-registry/blob/master/package-feeds.json)
   change using this feed URL:

   `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/medizininformatik-initiative/kerndatensatz-soziodemographie/gh-pages/package-feed.xml`

3. Add an exact package restriction for
   `de.medizininformatikinitiative.kerndatensatz.soziodemographie`.

This package-feed registration is separate from the new-IG or new-edition
`fhir-ig-list.json` change generated during publication.

## Steps for every release

### 1. Prepare the release on `main`

1. Update the release version, date, status, release label, changelog, package
   metadata, and FHIR package dependencies.
2. Update `publication-request.json` with the same version and the permanent
   Pages version URL. Keep the MII canonical in `sushi-config.yaml` and
   `package.json`.
3. Keep the MII KDS IG template referenced in `ig.ini`. Pin other FHIR package
   dependencies.
4. Commit and push `main`, then wait for its Pages preview workflow to
   finish successfully.

The publication date in `sushi-config.yaml` is authoritative.

### 2. Tag

1. Create and push an immutable `v<version>` tag on the release commit on
   `main`.

### 3. Run the publication dry run

From the `main` version of **Publish release with IG Publisher**, enter:

- `release_ref`: the immutable release tag;
- `publication_date`: blank only when the tagged commit date equals the date in
  `sushi-config.yaml`;
- `publish`: `false`.

Download and review the `publication-review` and `github-pages` artifacts:

- `qa.html`, `qa.json`, and `publication-process.log`;
- `source-publication.patch` and `ig-registry.patch`;
- `publication-toolchain.txt`, containing the resolved tool versions and
  publication-support repository commits;
- the staged Pages site and reported size; and
- the versioned `package.tgz`.

QA errors are allowed. The workflow requires valid `qa.json` and a nonempty
`package.tgz`, reports the QA counts, and lets Publisher `-go-publish` perform
its publication comparison. Expected messages are documented in
`input/ignoreWarnings.txt`.

Public package identifiers and URLs are reported by separate jobs that do not
consume the terminology secrets. This prevents GitHub's per-job secret masking
from replacing matching parts of otherwise public links with `***`.

Do not continue if the candidate, metadata, history, feeds, package, registry
patch, or deployment size is not acceptable.

### 4. Publish

Rerun **Publish release with IG Publisher** from `main` with the same tag and
publication date, and set `publish: true`.

The workflow rebuilds the candidate, preserves branch previews and existing
releases, commits it to `gh-pages`, deploys it, and verifies the history page,
version pages, and package downloads.

Confirm:

- `https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/kerndatensatz-soziodemographie/<version>/`
- `https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/kerndatensatz-soziodemographie/history.html`
- the date under **Current Versions** links to that permanent version URL.

### 5. Finish the release

1. Optionally attach the generated `package.tgz` to the draft GitHub Release.
   It is a convenience asset; the Pages package feed is the formal package
   channel.
2. Complete the release notes and publish the GitHub Release.
3. Prepare the next development version on `main`.

### 6. Optional: add the IG to the public FHIR guide directory

This step updates the source for
[`fhir.org/guides/registry`](https://www.fhir.org/guides/registry/). It is
independent of package-feed crawling and can be postponed until after the
release:

1. Within the seven-day artifact retention period, download
   `ig-registry.patch` from the successful production run's
   `publication-review` artifact. If it has expired, recreate the equivalent
   entry directly against the latest `FHIR/ig-registry` `fhir-ig-list.json`;
   do not rerun or retag the release.
2. Apply the patch to the latest `fhir-ig-list.json`, if using it.
3. Review the resulting IG entry and open an upstream pull request.

Publisher supplies the entry metadata from `publication-request.json`. Before
creating the patch, the workflow corrects the generated `history` and
`language` values and validates:

- description, authority, and country;
- `history` as
  `https://medizininformatik-initiative.github.io/kerndatensatz-soziodemographie/history.html`;
- `language` as `["en", "de"]`;
- canonical, CI-build URL, edition version, package, and publication URL; and
- absence of `??` placeholders.

The workflow never commits or opens the upstream registry pull request.

`publish-fsh-generated.yml` remains independent. It sends generated resources
to Simplifier for inspection and does not publish an NPM package.

## Rollback

1. Revert the publication commit on `gh-pages` with a normal revert commit and
   push it. Do not force-push.
2. Record the full SHA of the resulting `gh-pages` head.
3. Run **Deploy current gh-pages tree** with that SHA as `expected_sha`.
